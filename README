CONFIGURE
---------
Not all systems support the destination directories for manual pages and
binaries, edit the top of the Makefile to change these. Not ALL OF these
have been tested.

BUILD AND INSTALL UTILITIES
---------------------------
netstr has to be built for your platform. Tested platforms for this
release are:
	linux openbsd 
platforms that should work fine are:
	netbsd darwin freebsd
* cd to where the sources are
* make `uname` or make $platform-name (e.g. linux)

For instance - NetBSD do the following:
* cd to where the sources are
* make netbsd

Run `make install` to install to /usr/local/bin.

Note that you can scan without pcap capabilities for a scanner only.
To do so run:
	make ${platform}-scan
example:
	make linux-scan

UNINSTALL
---------
Run `make uninstall` in the source directory to remove.
