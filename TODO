TODO File for netstr 
- Shell and/or Perl wrappers/scripts such as:
   * Port iteration for scan6
   * Subnet iteration for scan and udpscan
   * Alias rcfile 
   * Servicename-to-port translator using /etc/services
   * Perl daemon that uses passive as a medicore IPS

- Consider adding a speedup based on percentage in scan4 software(s)
  Ex: if someone defines the timeout as 2 and --fast is specified 
      (which would be strange) drop by 10% (or .2) to 1.8

- ipv6 scan timer based off of how udpscan host timeout works

- IPv6 Packet dumping (in all of its glory including decoding). 
  Someday this has to be done, it is a "stop kicking the can" item
  pcap can deliver these at the same time so existing code needs to
  additions to handle v6 data

- parallel packet dumping while scanning.

- Better/more flexible port specification
