TODO File for netstr 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V-0.20-release
o the netstr guide book

o Proper UDP support

o Start wrapper scripts 

o Consider making the userspec timeout if it is lower than default --fast
  speedup a percentage drop of some sort.

o Build in classic UNIX style options. Users don't like being forced to
  exlcusively use GNUstyle long options only. At least where it is possible.

o switch to a full distribution format with src/ scripts/ lib/ etc.

o timer elapse for scan utils

o Better linebreaking capability for any packet dumping

o For any connection oriented stuff add in a method to grab the local network
  address and compare it to the remote hosts network address. If they are on
  the same network drop the useconds down to lowest possible value.

o ipv6 packet reading and handling

v-IN-YOUR-DREAMS

o an interpreter. No idea how that would work.

o parallel packet dumping while scanning.

o bolt on uhttpd server

o Listener, connect and concatenate support. No idea how to do these yet
  and they are major pieces of software. 

o more software modules where appropiate

o syn support

o banner support

o portN,portN1,portN2 support

o better packet reading ident?
