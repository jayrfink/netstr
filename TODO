TODO File for netstr 
This is more or less in order but not tied to a release

- ipv6 scan timer based off of how udpscan host timeout works

- Decoding is one common piece of pcap code that could go into its own
  software module (not program module), look for other pcap common bits
  that might be a canidate for that and move it all into pcap_ops or 
  something like that. Otherwise move it to the utility software module.
  Speaking of which look for more stuff to move to the utils software module.

- Without a doubt Passive probably could use fleshing out and even a 
  daemon mode possibly.

- Header files need properly ordered 

- Shell and/or Perl wrappers/scripts such as:
   * Port iteration for scan6
   * Subnet iteration for scan and udpscan
   * Alias rcfile 
   * Servicename-to-port translator using /etc/services
   * Perl daemon that uses passive as a medicore IPS

- Consider adding a speedup based on percentage in scan4 software(s)
  Ex: if someone defines the timeout as 2 and --fast is specified 
      (which would be strange) drop by 10% (or .2) to 1.8

- IPv6 Packet dumping (in all of its glory including decoding). 
  Someday this has to be done, it is a "stop kicking the can" item
  pcap can deliver these at the same time so existing code needs to
  additions to handle v6 data

- Porting to the BSDs, possibly start building packages for a variety of
  different Linux distros and BSD systems
   * Vet out useless includes during this process

- Once there are a few scripts and maybe more src files it might be time
  to reorganize the layout of the source distribution into subdirectories

- Better/more flexible port specification
