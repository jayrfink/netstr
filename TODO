TODO File for netstr 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v-0.19-patch
o The timeout print when -V is specified is wrong if you over ride it

o --fast and a timeout set lower than 0.3 seconds by the user are incompatible. 
  right now the program will accept them which means one actually raises
  the timeout after the first port connect :-)

o Start wrapper scripts 

o Scan6 needs a master timeout. Right now users can wrap it with a timeout
  command or shell built in but it isn't always a guarentee they will have
  that or know about it.

o UDP right now in some places is 'dgram' which is not entirely correct
  proper udp support needs to be setup for scanning softwares

o start/end time print for scan6

o better output for scan6  (verbose, quiet, isup only)

o Set default macros for the callout from passive to ipv4_conn.

o the netstr guide book

o scan verbosity needs more than what it has

V-0.20-release
o switch to a full distribution format with src/ scripts/ lib/ etc.

o timer elapse for scan utils

o Better linebreaking capability for any packet dumping

o For any connection oriented stuff add in a method to grab the local network
  address and compare it to the remote hosts network address. If they are on
  the same network drop the useconds down to lowest possible value.

o ipv6 packet reading and handling

v-IN-YOUR-DREAMS

o an interpreter. No idea how that would work.

o parallel packet dumping while scanning.

o bolt on uhttpd server

o Listener, connect and concatenate support. No idea how to do these yet
  and they are major pieces of software. 

o more software modules where appropiate
